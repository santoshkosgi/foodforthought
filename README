Food For Thought is a web application which allowa users to order food online.
It is built on Rails.mysql database is used.Bootstrap layout is used for this
application, the corresponding style sheets are saved in assets/stylesheets
folder.

The models in this application are:
	-User
	-User session
	-Hotel
	-Fooditems
	-Comments

each of these model have their own controllers and views. lets have a look into
what are the functionalities of these controllers
	User:
	this is the main model of this application. it has two types of users one is
	Admin, who can add hotels,fooditems to hotels and can edit them and the other
  is the normal user who can order food . Authlogic is used to provide
  authentication for user model. to use authlogic add
  	" acts_as_authentic" to the user model.
  firstly the user should register himself by providing details such as name,
  email,password and location. when the user registers using a postmark app
  registration success message is sent to his mail-id. to use postmark app
  firstly we need to define a mailer. Mailers are new models added in rails3.0.
  the following fuction is to be
  added in the mailer class
      def registration_confirmation(user)
        mail(:to => user.email, :subject => "Registered"
              ,:from => "name@domain.com", :tag => "registration")
      end
  the signature of the postmark is to be authenticated through command line.

Now, for user login authlogic provides a sessions class. on providing correct
credentials, it creates a session for the user. the logout destroys the session
and returns the control to the root of the application. On successful
authentication the user can check the list of hotels and items in hotels and add
comments to the hotels and the fooditems.
The model hotel and fooditem are associated by has_many and belongs_to
associations. Model comments is ploymorphically associated to the user and food
item.
